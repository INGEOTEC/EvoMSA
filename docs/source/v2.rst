EvoMSA is a stack generalization algorithm specialized in text classification
problems. A text classifier :math:`c`, can be seen as a composition of two functions,
i.e., :math:`c \equiv g \circ m`; where :math:`m` transforms the text into a vector space,
i.e., :math:`m: \text{text} \rightarrow \mathbb R^d` and :math:`g` is the classifier
(:math:`g: \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb N`) or regressor (:math:`g: \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb R`).
Stack generalization is a technique to combine classifiers (regressors) to produce 
another classifier (regressor) responsible for making the prediction. 

EvoMSA 2.0 removes two text representations, i.e., functions :math:`m`, particularly 
the sentiment lexicon-based model, and the aggressiveness model. It was decided 
to remove them because these models are the ones that require more work to be 
implemented in another language and, on the other hand, are the ones that 
contribute less to the performance of the algorithm. However, it increments
the number of human-annotated models, the emoji models, and introduces a new
model, namely keyword models.

EvoMSA 2.0 increments the number of supported languages, currently it
supports Arabic (ar), Catalan (ca), German (de), English (en), 
Spanish (es), French (fr), Hindi (hi), Indonesian (in), 
Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Dutch (nl),
Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru), Tagalog (tl), 
Turkish (tr), and Chinese (zh). It also provides pre-trained models
that include the bag-of-words text representations, emoji, 
and keyword models. These models were trained on Twitter data.
